# catsordogs
- A simple script that tells you if the chosen image is that of a cat or a dog.
- Uses [my binary classifier model](https://github.com/jun6000/cats-or-dogs-model).

## Features
- Can differentiate between cats and dogs, nothing more, nothing less.
- If the input image consists of other subjects, the model might not classify it accurately.
- Similarly if an image consists of both dogs and cats output will be incorrect.

**Note:** This project was created solely for my learning experience and is not meant to serve as a production-ready binary classifier.
