# catsordogs
- A simple script that tells you if the chosen image is that of a cat or a dog.
- Uses [my binary classifier model](https://github.com/jun6000/cats-or-dogs-model).

## Features
- Can differentiate between cats and dogs, nothing more, nothing less.
- If the input image consists of other subjects, the model might not classify it accurately.
- Similarly if an image consists of both dogs and cats output will be incorrect.

## Installation
- Install using pip
```
pip install catsordogs
```
- Then run using one of the two ways given below,
```
catsordogs
```
(or)
```
python -m catsordogs
```
- Supply the input image file when prompted and the results are displayed as shown below.
